# block_test
This is a sample filter driver module. The block_test module will create 
a virtual block device, and open an actual device as its lower device.
All bio from upper device will submit to lower device.
This block_test just recognize which direction of bio. If the dir of bio 
is WRITE, we will record the info of it and then submit. If the dir of bio 
is READ, we directly submit it to lower device.
